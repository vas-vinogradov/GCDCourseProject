##Course Project File

Script goes through following steps:

1. Reading feature names to label columns
2. Reading activity labels to mark them later
3. Reading Main test file 
4. Set column names from file
5. Load Activity data
6. Load Subject data
7. Merge Activity, Subject and Main Data
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for Train Data
9. Merging Train and Test Data (The only way for me is simple row bind)
10. Filtering columns we will need to 
11. Piping group by and summarise_each to produce final tidy data set
12. Saving to result file you can see on submission page
